Starving the beast on ethernet v.000002
Place this file in /etc/network/if-up.d NetworkManager will call it
for you automagically when the interface is brought up.

It would be a good idea to call something on interface down, too.
But I haven't written it yet.

Today's ethernet device drivers are over-optimized for 1000Mbit
If you are unfortunate enough to run at less than that
you are going to lose on latency. As one example you will
have over 130ms latency under load with the default settings in the e1000e
driver - common to many laptops. 

To force your network device to 100Mbit 
(so you can test and then bitch about bloat in your driver)
ethtool -s your_device advertise 0x008
It will then stay stuck at 100Mbit until you change it back.
It also helps to lower your ring buffer as far as it will go
ethtool -G your_device tx 64 # or lower if you can
And after doing all that you wil be lucky to get 120ms latency under load.

Adding in the below, without byte queue limits enabled, and cbq, gets you to
around 12ms. With byte queue limits, I can get to ~4-6 ms latency under load.
However, (less often of late), I sometimes end up at 130ms. 
It would be my hope, with some more tuning (QFQ?), better SFQ setup?
to get below 1 ms.
